# **My First AI Project - Study Helper** 📚

Hi! I'm a first-year student in Software Engineering at Centennial College, and this is my first try at making something with AI. I'm really excited to share this project because it's the first real program I've built from scratch!

## **What This Is**

I made a simple chatbot that can answer questions about Python programming. It's like a study buddy that knows about basic coding concepts. You can ask it things like:
- "what's a variable?"
- "how do functions work?" 
- "tell me about loops"

It's not super smart like the AI in movies, but it actually works! I built it using only the stuff I've learned in my first semester.

## **How I Made It**

I used these things from my classes:
- **Dictionaries** to store all the answers
- **If/else statements** to make decisions
- **While loops** to keep the conversation going
- **Functions** to organize my code (this was hard but I got it!)
- **String methods** to understand what people type

## **What I Learned Building This**

- Coding is actually fun when you build real things!
- Breaking big problems into small parts helps a lot
- My code was messy at first, but I kept making it better
- Even simple programs can be useful
- I want to learn more about AI now!

## **Stuff I Want to Add Later**

When I learn more, I want to:
- Make it understand better English
- Add more programming topics
- Maybe make a web version
- Let it learn from its mistakes

## **About Me**

I'm just starting my programming journey at Centennial College. Before this, I worked in sales for 3 years, but I realized I love technology and problem-solving. This is my first real coding project, and I'm really proud of it even though it's simple!

If you're also learning to code, feel free to use this project or give me suggestions! 😄
